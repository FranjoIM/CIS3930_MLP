# Overview
In this study, we leverage multi-modal, longitudinal data from ABCD
study and multi-kernel machine learning approaches to accurately classify ambiguous
OCD cases and increase power to downstream genetic analyses. We leverage logistic
regression model with elastic net penalty to train each kernel independently, followed by
accuracy-weighted case probability score summed across kernels
